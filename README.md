The data is of world temp deviations from a baseline from 1991 to 2020 and the dates are from 1978 to 2023.

The plot widget, line of best fit, creates a line of best fit based on the current data being shown.
You can change which region data you are viewing as well as the color scheme with the other two widgets.

On the table you can change how uch time the average of deviations is taken over, whether it is by month, by year, or decade.
